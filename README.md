# Stock-Market-Prediction

# Overview
This project explores the application of candlestick patterns to predict stock market trends. Candlestick patterns have been widely recognized for their ability to provide valuable insights into price movements and market sentiment. By leveraging this historical data, we aim to create predictive models that assist in making informed investment decisions.

# Features
**Candlestick Pattern Analysis:** We use historical stock price data to identify and analyze various candlestick patterns, including doji, engulfing, hammer, and more.

**Machine Learning Models:** We employ machine learning techniques to develop predictive models that use candlestick patterns as features. These models are designed to forecast future stock price movements.

**ARIMA Time Series Analysis:** In addition to candlestick patterns, we explore ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) time series analysis to capture the underlying trends and patterns in stock prices.

Data Visualization: We provide visualizations of candlestick patterns, historical stock prices, and model predictions to facilitate a better understanding of the data and results.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Data sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)
3. Libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)

# Usage
**Data Collection:** Obtain historical stock price data for the target company using an appropriate data source or API.

**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data, including feature engineering to identify candlestick patterns.

**Model Development:** Train machine learning models or ARIMA models using the preprocessed data.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques such as cross-validation.

**Prediction:** Use the trained model to make predictions on future stock price movements.

**Visualization:** Visualize the candlestick patterns, historical prices, and model predictions to
